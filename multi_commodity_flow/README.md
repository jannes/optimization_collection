#Description
The multicommodity flow problem is to satisfy all flow demands for a directed graph with associated flow capacities for each arc,
while minimzing the total cost (each arc has an associated cost per unit of flow through it).
For each commodity k there is a required flow from an origin node (source) to a terminal node (sink).

#Requirements
Setting up CPLEX (include a cplex jar in the libs directory and create run configuration according to CPLEX docs).

#Running the solver
Import the project into some IDE, setup the run cofiguration, run the Main.java.

#Data format
See the examples
