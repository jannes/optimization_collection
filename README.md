This is a collection of optimization problems with algorithms that solve them.
Some algorithms make use of MIP solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi.

# Problems
## Facility location
An Integer Programming approach to solving facility location with eucledian distances is implemented.

## Multi-commodity flow
A Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition approach with each commodity as an activity is implemented.

## Single machine scheduling total tardiness
A pseudopolynomial dynamic programming approach to solve minimum total tardiness exactly and also a FPTAS approximation algorithm.
These algorithms are describe by Lawler in [“A “pseudopolynomial” algorithm for sequencing jobs to minimize total tardiness”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167506008707428) and [“A fully polynomial approximation scheme for the total tardiness problem”](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0167637782900220).
