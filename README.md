This is a collection of optimization problems with algorithms that solve them.
Some algorithms make use of MIP solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi.

# Problems
## Facility location
An Integer Programming approach to solving facility location with eucledian distances is implemented.

## Multi-commodity flow
A Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition approach with each commodity as an activity is implemented.
